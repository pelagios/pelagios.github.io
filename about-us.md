The Pelagios Network is a long-running initiative that links information online through common references to places. 
To create and maintain these connections, Pelagios has developed: 
- a method for creating semantic annotations, based on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model">W3C Web Annotation</a> standard;
- tools and specifications for creating and making use of these annotations, most notably <a href="https://recogito.pelagios.org/">Recogito</a>, an open-source platform for geo-annotating texts, images and databases;
- a community of individuals and organizations working with geographic data in humanities disciplines (history, language and literary studies, archaeology, etc.), and cultural heritage (galleries, libraries, archives and museums).

### How does it work?
In order to sustain and further develop work in this area, the Pelagios Network focuses on six core Activities, which are: 
- <a href="https://pelagios.github.io/activities/annotation/">Annotation</a>, which supports the use of semantic annotation to link and explore historical place information; 
- <a href="https://pelagios.github.io/activities/collaboration/">Collaboration</a>, which provides a forum for all Project Partners to share resources and collaborate;
- <a href="https://pelagios.github.io/activities/gazetteers/">Gazetteers</a>, which establishes core requirements for global authority files on historic places and their alignment;
- <a href="https://pelagios.github.io/activities/pedagogy/">Pedagogy</a>, which supports the use of linked data in education and cultural heritage;
- <a href="https://pelagios.github.io/activities/registry/">Registry</a>, which establishes services for registering and discovering linked data collections for places;
- <a href="https://pelagios.github.io/activities/visualisation/">Visualisation</a> which develops methods and tools which make use of semantic annotation.

### How can I get involved?
Pelagios is a formal Network of equal and independent <a href="https://pelagios.org/partners/">**Partners**</a> who coordinate their work together, and a wider community of **Members** who have an interest in the Network's outputs. Partners may nominate Representatives who can then have a say in the coordination of an Activity, and can become an Activity Coordinator. 

- To become a Partner, individuals and institutions can jointly agree a set of contributions to one or more of the Activities with the Network’s governing Committee, formalised through a Memorandum of Understanding*;
- To become a Member, simply sign up to the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pelagios-announcements/">Discussion</a> list.

*_MoUs are voluntary, there are no fees or subscriptions, and Partners remain in full control of their own work plans and resources_.
