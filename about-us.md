The Pelagios Network is a long-running initiative that links information online through common references to places.
To create and maintain these connections, Pelagios has developed:
- a method for creating semantic annotations, based on the [W3C Web Annotation](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model) standard;
- tools and specifications for creating and making use of these annotations, most notably [Recogito](https://recogito.pelagios.org/), an open-source platform for geo-annotating texts, images and databases;
- a community of individuals and organizations working with geographic data in humanities disciplines (history, language and literary studies, archaeology, etc.), and cultural heritage (galleries, libraries, archives and museums).

### How does it work?
In order to sustain and further develop work in this area, the Pelagios Network focuses on six core Activities, which are:
- [Annotation](https://pelagios.github.io/activities/annotation/), which supports the use of semantic annotation to link and explore historical place information;
- [Collaboration](https://pelagios.github.io/activities/collaboration/), which provides a forum for all Project Partners to share resources and collaborate;
- [Gazetteers](https://pelagios.github.io/activities/gazetteers/), which establishes core requirements for global authority files on historic places and their alignment;
- [Pedagogy](https://pelagios.github.io/activities/pedagogy/), which supports the use of linked data in education and cultural heritage;
- [Registry](https://pelagios.github.io/activities/registry/), which establishes services for registering and discovering linked data collections for places;
- [Visualisation](https://pelagios.github.io/activities/visualisation/) which develops methods and tools which make use of semantic annotation.

### How can I get involved?
Pelagios is a formal Network of equal and independent [**Partners**](https://pelagios.org/partners/) who coordinate their work together, and a wider community of **Members** who have an interest in the Network's outputs. Partners may nominate Representatives who can then have a say in the coordination of an Activity, and can become an Activity Coordinator.

- To become a Partner, individuals and institutions can jointly agree a set of contributions to one or more of the Activities with the Networkâ€™s governing Committee, formalised through a Memorandum of Understanding*;
- To become a Member, simply sign up to the [Discussion](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/pelagios-network/) list.

*_MoUs are voluntary, there are no fees or subscriptions, and Partners remain in full control of their own work plans and resources_.
