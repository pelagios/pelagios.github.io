Pelagios is a free formal Network of equal and independent <a href="https://pelagios.org/partners/">Partners</a> who coordinate their work together, and a wider community of Members who have an interest in the Networkâ€™s outputs.
Partners can be individuals or else represent a particular project or institution. Partnerships with the Pelagios Network are established through a formally agreed workplan, which we call a Memorandum of Understanding <a href="https://github.com/pelagios/pelagios.github.io/files/6414037/MoUTemplate.pdf">(MoU)</a>. While not legally binding, the MoU usefully focuses both prospective Partner and the Network on getting stuff done. There are no fees or subscriptions, and Partners remain in full control of their own work plans and resources.

To become a Partner:
- Check which of our <a href="https://pelagios.org/activities/">Activities</a> best aligns with your work and your interests.
- Send an email to the Officers (officers@pelagios.org) to begin discussing your MoU. 
- Once drafted, your MoU is shared with the relevant Activity Coordinators, for questions and comments.
- After you have responded to the feedback, your proposed Partnerships is voted on by all Coordinators.
- Typically this process should take no more than 2 weeks.
