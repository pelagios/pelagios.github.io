The Pelagios officers are delighted to invite you to a network-wide talk by Ruth Mostern titled The World Historical Gazetteer Version 3. To be held on Sept 17, 9am ET/2pm BST - Click [here](https://mytime.io/2pm/BST) for your time.

The World Historical Gazetteer, which has been in development for seven years, is a platform for linking records about historical places, allowing people to make spatial connections across time and language.  Version 3, released in summer 2024, permits users to search its index of more than two million places; and to upload, augment, annotate, link, and publish information about places as individual datasets, multiple connected datasets, and thematically linked collections of indexed places.  This talk introduces the methodology and functionality of the WHG and explains how to become a contributor.

Ruth Mostern is Professor of History and Director of the World History Center at the University of Pittsburgh

The officers feel the network as a whole would benefit from hearing about the exciting new features in version 3, as World Historical Gazetteer has played such a fundamental role in shaping Pelagios activities. We would also like to take this opportunity to thank Karl Grossner for his immense contribution through World Historical Gazetteer and more. All the best for your retirement, Karl.

We look forward to seeing you online.
