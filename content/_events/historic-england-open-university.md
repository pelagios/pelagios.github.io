On Tuesday June 11, 2024, Historic England, The Open University, and The Pelagios Network will be hosting a workshop on 
digital tools, methods and infrastructure in academia, cultural heritage, and the creative industries. Our focus will be
on lightweight tools that anybody can use to enrich place data, make maps, and link information to shed new light on texts, 
objects, and databases.

In particular, we will be showcasing tools that are community maintained and supported. This will include the launch of 
new modular Recogito annotation tool, a hands-on tutorial on using Peripleo to build your own maps of things related to 
place, and a ~~demonstration of Historic England's implementation of Arches~~ discussion of Cambridge University's use of Arches. In addition to exploring real-life use cases 
in the wild, the workshop will encourage discussion of issues relating to public engagement and citizen science; 
interoperability and infrastructure; and community development and sustainability.

We look forward to seeing you there or online.

## <a id="videos"></a> Videos from Teams 

We have captured video footage of nearly all the speakers from this event via the live MicroSoft Teams call. These are 
a little rough and ready, but we hope they will be useful for those who could not attend. Amara Thornton's has 
some corruption and will be added if possible. We may clean these up slightly and fix the subtitles and transcriptions where glaring errors exist.
