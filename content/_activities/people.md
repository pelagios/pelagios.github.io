Works towards consensus and standards for common representation of historical people in structured Linked Open Data

The aim of the LOD People Activity is to survey practice and collect guidance in the handling of interoperable Linked Open Data relating to historical person datasets. Rather than replacing existing solutions around shared person data formats, we recommend lightweight, minimal standards for interchange data, compatible with Pelagios registries, APIs and annotation tools. Needs and solutions will arise from consultation with communities of practice and stakeholders, in close collaboration with other PN activities. Results and discussions are disseminated openly throughout via online platforms, forums and repositories.
